### Analysis Procedures

After downloading/cloning this repository, run `script.R` to automate the analysis process. The file uses other R files and functions to perform the necessary analysis. You may opt to do the process manually by using the given functions. For more details about the functions, check `CODEBOOK.md`.

Inside `script.R`, there is a code sourcing `descriptive.R`. That R script contains all the descriptive statistics of the COVID-19 Cases. You can find the guides for reproduction by accessing `descriptive.R`. For in-depth detail, visit `COVID-19-Descriptive-Analysis.md`

### Branching Guidelines

For version control, it is advised to branch from the `master` before performing any statistical analysis.
